A mini React library that abstracts the generation of forms from a JSON.

```
npm install react-jsonform-shape
```

### Core Features

1. JSON to Form - Generate your form based on your component JSON “state”.
2. Grid or Template system - Write the grid containers, where your input controls should belong
3. No other dependency (for the time being)
